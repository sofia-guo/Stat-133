# Warm-up 01 - Markdown Practice

The purpose of this assignment is to work with an `Rmd` file and practice 
writing content using markdown syntax.


In the yaml header of your Rmd file, please modify the `output` field.

Change it from `output: html_document` to `output: github_document`.

This will generate an `md` file that when pushed (uploaded) to github, it
will get nicely rendered (except for the equations in latex).
